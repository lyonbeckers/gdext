# Note about Jetbrains IDEs: "IDE Sync" (Refresh Cargo projects) may cause static analysis errors such as
# "at most one `api-*` feature can be enabled". This is because by default, all Cargo features are enabled,
# which isn't a setup we support. To address this, individual features can be enabled in the various
# Cargo.toml files: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/rust-cfg-support.html#enable-disable-feature-manually.
